Revision history for CGI-Application-Plugin-LinkIntegrity

0.03 ????
        - NOTE:  This release is not compatible with previous versions.
        - API radically rewritten to make it possible to protect links
          directly from within templates (Thanks to Michael Peter and
          Mark Stosberg for the feedback and ideas)
        - the following methods have changed:

          Old Syntax                                         New Syntax
          ==========                                         ==========
          ->make_link($url, { 'p1' => 'v1'})                 ->link($url, 'p1' => 'v1')

          ->make_self_link($url,                             ->self_link($url, 'p1' => 'v1')
                            keep_path_info => 1,
                            params => { 'p1' => 'v1'})

          ->make_self_link($url,                             ->path_link('', 'p1' => 'v1')
                            keep_path_info => 0,
                            params => { 'p1' => 'v1'})

          ->make_self_link($url,                             ->path_link('/new/path', 'p1' => 'v1')
                            path_info => '/new/path'
                            params => { 'p1' => 'v1'}
                          )

          etc. directly from templates
